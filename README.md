# Vertical Overview

## Description
Gnome has had vertically stacked workspaces for a long time. The Gnome 40 update unfortunately made the switch to a horizontal layout. A choice that many Gnome users disagree with. This extension Aims to replace the new Gnome overview with something that resembles the old style.

## Donations
I never expected this to be something I have to consider. I really don't expect anyone to donate, nor do I want anyone to feel obligated to do so. I do this because I enjoy it and will for sure keeping working on it as long as I can. However multiple people have asked me to make a donation button, so here it is. If you are considering donating, Thank you so much! I really appreciate it.
